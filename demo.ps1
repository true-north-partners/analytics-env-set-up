$WELCOME = "This repository is dedicated to hosting a PowerShell script designed to be used 
on a Windows sandbox during startup. The purpose of the script is to 
automate the setup of a Python environment tailored for analytics work. This is 
particularly useful for projects requiring a consistent and automated setup 
process for analytics environments on a sandbox.

This script is designed to be used in conjunction with the Windows Sandbox for 
now given it is still experimental. Eventually this project will be modifed to 
work on a regular Windows environment.
